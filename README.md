# SOC Automation Project

## Objective

The objective of the SOC Automation project was to set up a comprehensive home lab that replicates a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. The project focused on automating security operations to improve the efficiency of incident response and enhance threat detection capabilities. By integrating various security tools, the goal was to streamline processes, enable real-time monitoring, and generate actionable insights from security events.

### Skills Learned

- Gained a solid understanding of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and their practical applications.
- Developed proficiency in automating incident response workflows using Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools.
- Acquired hands-on experience with case management systems to effectively track and resolve security incidents.
- Enhanced analytical skills for interpreting security logs and identifying potential threats.
- Learned to create and manage alerts that simulate real-world security scenarios, improving incident detection.

### Tools Used

- **Wazuh**: Deployed as the primary SIEM and XDR solution for log ingestion, analysis, and alert generation.
- **The Hive**: Utilized for managing cases, providing a centralized platform for incident tracking and resolution.
- **Shuffle**: Implemented for automating security workflows, enabling a more efficient incident response process.
- **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: Leveraged for data storage and visualization, creating dashboards to monitor security events in real time.
